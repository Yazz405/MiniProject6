# sorting-mini-project
As the name suggests, it's our mini-project for the sorting lab.

Author: Alma Ordaz
Purpose: Use various generic sorting algorithms to sort arrays of any type given a comparator
Aknowledgements: 
- Sam R: stubs from labs, and help on quicksort
- Noah Mendola: worked on QuickSort together in class

OrdazAlmaSort: Using chatGPT did not produce code that not usable, in order to use it all I had to do was correct the class it implements and then fix the declaration of some of the methods for it to run and pass my tests. Because it used insertation sort so I replaced it with my quicksort and my mergesort hoping its faster. However running the tests, in VS code it shows that the difference is very minimal. Using chatGPTs insertionSort and merge gave a time from 1.3s-1.5s and the same range holds when I changed it to my quickSort and merge.
