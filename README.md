Aknowledgements: 
- Sam R: stubs from labs, and help on quicksort
- Noah Mendola: worked on QuickSort together in class

OrdazAlmaSort: Using chatGPT did not produce code that not usable, in order to use it all I had to do was correct the class it implements and then fix the declaration of some of the methods for it to run and pass my tests.
